        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            A Mexican style spread out hamburger meal is a great and plentiful dinner dish. The abundance of flavors and ingredients hit just right and will want you begging for more. This
            recipe takes some time to prepare, but shouldn't be too complicated using mainly just a large pot. Each of the ingredients has to be boiled for a certain amount of time to ensure
            good texture and to prevent over or underdamping that can miss the mark.

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package mostaccioli pasta</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 (24 ounce) jar picante sauce</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can stewed tomatoes with juice</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups shredded Mexican-style cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly saled water to a boil.</li>
            <li>Cook mostaccioli at a boil until cooked through yet firm to the bite,
                about 11 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Cook and stir ground beef in a large pot over medium-high heat until
                crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain and discard any excess grease.</li>
            <li>Add picante sauce and stewed tomatoes to the ground beef; cook,
                stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes soften completely, about 10
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Gently stir the cooked mostaccioli into the ground beef mixture.</li>
            <li>Add Mexican-style cheese; cook and stir until the cheese is melted,
                about 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
